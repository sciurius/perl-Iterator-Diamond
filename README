Iterator::Diamond
=================

Iterator::Diamond provides a safe and customizable replacement for the
<> (Diamond) operator.

Just like <> it returns the records of all files specified in @ARGV,
one by one, as if it were one big happy file. In-place editing of
files is also supported. It does use @ARGV, $ARGV and ARGVOUT as
documented in perlrun, though without magic.

As opposed to the built-in <> operator, no magic is applied to the
file names unless explicitly requested. This means that you're
protected from file names that may wreak havoc to your system when
processed through the magic of the two-argument open that Perl
normally uses for <>.

Perl as of version 5.22 supports a new double-diamond operator <<>>
to get similar security.
